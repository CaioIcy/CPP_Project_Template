Forked from [opatry's template]:
> "This project is used as a basis for any C++ project built with CMake. Its purpose is to provide a full featured (code coverage, unit tests, static analysis, â€¦) and cross platform build. It tries to use CMake in the most effective way."

# Dependencies

From **[.travis.yml](.travis.yml)** (_Ubuntu_):  
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -qq cmake doxygen g++-4.8 python-pip cppcheck valgrind ggcov
sudo pip install Pygments
sudo pip install gcovr
sudo pip install cpp-coveralls
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 90
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.8 80
```

# Building

 `./build.sh debug`   
 or
 `./build.sh release`
 
This will produce:
- Project Executable (_build/src/MyProject_exec_)
- Test Executable (_build/src/MyProject_GTest_)
- Doxygen documentation (_build/doc/html/_)
- Several reports (_/build/reports/_)

# Webpage

The GitHub webpage is available here: [Project Webpage]  

All the documentation and reports are automatically published to it with **Travis-CI**, using the **[publish to gh-pages](utils/publish_to_ghpages.sh)** script. The idea is that every project derived from this template can also have this format of auto-publishing stuff.

To achieve this, you must have an access token to your repository, so **Travis-CI** can push to the gh-pages branch. A nice tutorial can be found [here](http://benlimmer.com/2013/12/26/automatically-publish-javadoc-to-gh-pages-with-travis-ci/) in steps 1 through 4.

# Notes

The Google Test framework was originally downloaded through SVN on every build, but I didn't want any internet connection dependency.  
Through [dmonopoly's project] I learned how to include it with my project (so thanks).
