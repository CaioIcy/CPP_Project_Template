Forked from [opatry's template]:
> "This project is used as a basis for any C++ project built with CMake. Its purpose is to provide a full featured (code coverage, unit tests, static analysis, â€¦) and cross platform build. It tries to use CMake in the most effective way."

# Customization

If you wish to work on a C++ project using this template, please read the [customization instructions](customization.md) file. If there are any problems, please open an issue here!

# Dependencies

From **[the Travis scripts](utils/travis/)** (_Ubuntu_):  
```
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -qq cmake doxygen g++-4.8 python-pip cppcheck valgrind ggcov
sudo pip install Pygments
sudo pip install gcovr
sudo pip install cpp-coveralls
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 90
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.8 80
```

# Building

 `./build.sh debug`  
 _Debug information (-g), zero-level optimization (-O0) and gcov flags._
 
`./build.sh release`  
_Third-level optimization (-O3) and treat warnings as errors (-Werror)_
 
Both will produce:
- Project Executable (_build/src/PROJECTNAME_exec_)
- Test Executable (_build/src/PROJECTNAME_GTest_)
- [Doxygen documentation](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/doxygen/) (_build/doc/html/_)

 `./build.sh debug windows` and  `./build.sh release windows`
 _Will use MinGW to cross compile to Windows_

# Generating reports and packaging

`./utils/travis/after_success.sh`

This will produce the following reports in _build/reports/_:
- [Cppcheck HTML](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/reports/cppcheck-reports/)
- [Cpplint HTML](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/reports/cpplint-reports/)
- [Valgrind XML](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/reports/valgrind-exec-report.xml)
- [Google Test XML](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/reports/gtest-report.xml)
- [Gcovr HTML](https://caioicy.github.io/CPP_Project_Template/reports/gcovr-reports/)

And if this script is ran from within **Travis-CI**, it will publish all the reports, doxygen documentation to the [Project Webpage] in the _gh-pages_ branch, and it will publish the coverage report to [Coveralls].

# Webpage

The GitHub webpage is available here: [Project Webpage]  

As mentioned, all the documentation and reports are automatically published to it from within **Travis-CI**, using the **[after success script](utils/travis/after_success.sh)**. The idea is that every project derived from this template can also have this format of auto-publishing stuff.

To achieve this, you must have an access token to your repository, so **Travis-CI** can push to the gh-pages branch. A nice tutorial can be found [here](http://benlimmer.com/2013/12/26/automatically-publish-javadoc-to-gh-pages-with-travis-ci/) in steps 1 through 4.

# Notes

The Google Test framework was originally downloaded through SVN on every build, but I didn't want any internet connection dependency.  
Through [dmonopoly's project] I learned how to include it with my project (so thanks).
