# C++ / CMake / gtest Project Template
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CaioIcy/cpp-cmake-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CaioIcy/cpp-cmake-template)

Forked from [opatry's template]:
> This project is used as a basis for any C++ project built with CMake. Its purpose is to provide a full featured (code coverage, unit tests, static analysis, â€¦) and cross platform build. It tries to use CMake in the most effective way.

For now, I personally want this to support at least:
- CMake
- gtest
- Travis

With plans of adding:
- Static analysis
- Packaging
