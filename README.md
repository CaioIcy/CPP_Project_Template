# C++ Project Template GitHub WebPage

For now, these variables need to be changed manually in the [index.html](index.html) for everything to work smoothly in the site.

```
var GitHub_User = 'CaioIcy';
var GitHub_Project_Name = 'CPP_Project_Template';
var Project_Name = 'Cool_Project_Name';
var Project_Build_Linux = Project_Name + '-Linux.zip';
```
